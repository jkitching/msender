## Roadmap

Generally speaking, we aim to make this codebase less specific to L214's use and less specific to the French environment (yay to a more international Msender!).

* Move away from [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and make it possible to have different themes (and override themes), so users can customize it to adapt to their style guidelines
* Filter by Department is very specific to France and should be made more flexible: either making it outside the project, or making a more generic "filter by region" with a country locale (French departments, US states, German Länder, etc.) (the field `Recipient.department_code` in not generic)
* Translate the Recipient titles (currently `M.` and `Mme` in French)
* Add the ability to add more custom email clients (to fit speicific users and country use-cases)

## Email client specificities (2015 research)

### Webmails specificities

* Hotmail : BCC can't be autocompleted with URL parameter
* Yahoo : subject can't be autocompleted with URL parameter; only one email adress per field can be passed with the     URL parameters (emails seperation is done with JS so semicolons won't work)
* Free : body can't be autocompleted with URL parameter
* Orange, SFR, Laposte won't take any URL parameter

#### Misc info

* Get requests characters limitations by webmail :
* Windows Live Hotmail : ~1750 chars
* Gmail : ~1900 chars
* Yahoo Mail : ~7000 chars
* Client : ~1500 chars
* (limitations are after url encoding)

* Mail clients statistics for France pop :
* 1 - Orange => ~27%
* 2 - Hotmail/Outlook => ~19%
* 3 - Gmail => ~19%
* 4 - SFR => ~11%
* 5 - Yahoo => ~11%
