## API

### Event `msenderReady` (wait for loading)

It's recommended to load the Msender JavaScript file after other page assets (ideally using `<script async>`) for a better user experience. For that reason, it's necessary to wait for the MSender bundle to be loaded before calling its API.

```js
window.addEventListener('msenderReady', function() {
  // window.msender is available
});
```

### Initialize with `renderContainer`

```js
msender.renderContainer(domElement, params);
```

* `domElement` *(DOM element or string)*: The DOM element where Msender will be rendered. If a string is passed, it will be interpreted as a Selector and the first matching selector will be used.
* `params` *(object)*: A JavaScript object (dictionary) containing the parameters (as described in the [Parameters](#Parameters) section below).

## Parameters

### `to`

A list of `Recipient`s to send the email to. Can be filtered based on user inputs (see `filter_recipient`). See below for a full spec of the `Recipient` object.

    "last_name": "Appleseed",
    "organization": "Apple Inc.",
    "email": "john@apple.com",
    "gender": "m",
    "format": "titlefull",

  }
]
```

### `cc`

A list of `Recipient`s to send the email to as `cc`.

### `bcc`

A list of `Recipient`s to send the email to as `bcc`.


Example:

```json
[
  {
    "email": "cyberaction-copie@l214.com"

```

### `subject`

The email subject.

### `message`

How the recipient list (the `to` parameter described above) should be filtered. Possible values are:

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `all` (default) | Always send to all recipient list |
| `manual` | Will add a select field to let the user choose one recipient in the list |
| `department` | Will add a select to choose a French department and will filter recipient by department |
| `none` | Won't show the recipient field, to be used to let users send emails to their friends |

### `select_department`

What French departments to show in the list. Possible values are:

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `null` | No department picker will be shown (no department in the list) |

### `send_mailchimp`

### `mailchimp_source`

### `locale`

The locale (language and country) to use for internationalization. By default, it falls back to the browser's locale, or English (`en`) if not available.

The following language codes are currently supported: `en`, `fr`, `de`, `es`, `pt`, `it`, `nl`.

The UI elements are currently only translated in English and French. You can use the `translations` key to add custom translations.


Example:

```js
locale: 'es-ES'
```


### `translations`

Override the current translation strings or add additional languages.

Example:

```js
translations: {
  es: {

| `laposte` | Laposte.net | *France* üá´üá∑ |

### `max_chars`

Maximum number of characters (max length) allowed in the URL. This is useful to support long lists of receipients especially with online services (e.g. Gmail, Yahoo!) where URL is limited by the HTTP spec and servers.

If set, the list of recipients will be truncated to fit in the given length, with a minimum of 1 recipient.

Example:

```js
max_chars: 2000,
```

### `max_chars_randomize`

If set to `true` the list of recipients selected with `max_chars` will be randomized (instead of picking the first ones).

Example:

```js

```

## Roadmap

Generally speaking, we aim to make this codebase less specific to L214's use and less specific to the French environment (yay to a more international Msender!).

* Move away from [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and make it possible to have different themes (and override themes), so users can customize it to adapt to their style guidelines
* Filter by Department is very specific to France and should be made more flexible: either making it outside the project, or making a more generic "filter by region" with a country locale (French departments, US states, German L√§nder, etc.) (the field `Recipient.department_code` in not generic)
* Translate the Recipient titles (currently `M.` and `Mme` in French)
* Add the ability to add more custom email clients (to fit speicific users and country use-cases)

## Email client specificities (2015 research)

### Webmails specificities

* Hotmail : BCC can't be autocompleted with URL parameter
* Yahoo : subject can't be autocompleted with URL parameter; only one email adress per field can be passed with the     URL parameters (emails seperation is done with JS so semicolons won't work)
* Free : body can't be autocompleted with URL parameter
* Orange, SFR, Laposte won't take any URL parameter

#### Misc info

* GET requests characters limitations by webmail:
* Windows Live Hotmail : ~1750 chars
* Gmail : ~1900 chars
* Yahoo Mail : ~7000 chars
* Client : ~1500 chars
* (limitations are after url encoding)

* Mail clients statistics for France pop :
* 1 - Orange => ~27%
* 2 - Hotmail/Outlook => ~19%
* 3 - Gmail => ~19%
* 4 - SFR => ~11%
* 5 - Yahoo => ~11%
